GC2USB GameCube to USB (host) adapter.

Hardware design is based on todays bleeding edge Cortex-M4 Microcontroller with 1M byte flash memory. 
While this may sound as overkill, this MCU is cheap and really nice. 

Development will be done on STM32F3DISCOVERY evaluation boards, USB Memory stick Bootloader tested!
